## Data Structures & Algorithms
<!-- each section covers adding, removing, searching and sorting -->

Data Structure Overview

### Section 1: Linear Data Structures

- Arrays
- Lists
  - Linked Lists 
    - singly linked list
    - doubly linked list
    - circular linked list
- Stacks
- Queues

### Section 2: Non-linear Data Structures

- Maps
- Graphs
- Trees
- Heaps

### Section 3: Problem Solving

- Time & Space Complexity
- Bit Manipulation
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

## Problem Sets

### Level 1: Beginner
<!-- Beginner problem sets are easier and will give more guidance to the optimal answer -->
<!-- - Detect Palindrome  -->
<!-- - Two Sum -->

### Level 2: Intermediate

### Level 3: Hard
<!--  More vague and requires more dynamic programming skills -->
