## Choosing the right Data Structure for the Job
When confronted with the decision of what data structure to use, there are a few questions you can ask yourself that will help guide you to an optimal choice.

  - Is there a pattern to the adding and removing of elements?
  
- How often will elements need to be read?
  - Will said elements be read in a specific order? Or randomly?
  
- Do the elements need to be in a specific order?
